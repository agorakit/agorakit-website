            <p>
                <strong>Writing</strong> the code of Agorakit, testing it and adding new features takes a lot of time and patience.
            </p>

            <p>
                Managing the shared Agora on app.agorakit.org takes also some ressources (including moderation and end user support).
            </p>

            <p>
                You want to support the project? Your group uses <a href="https://app.agorakit.org" target="_blank">the shared Agora</a>? Or you use Agorakit somewhere else and want to see it evolves quicker?
            </p>
            <p>
                You think it's important to offer free, non proprietary collaborative spaces to everyone?
            </p>



            <p><strong>Your donation, big or small will help the project : thank you!</strong></p>

            <h1>Questions</h1>

            <h2 class="mt-3">How much should I give?</h2>


            <p>
                You really give what you want and what your group can afford. You might also choose to use Agorakit and the shared Agora for free, this is fine too :-).
            </p>




            <h2 class="mt-5">I thought open source software was free?</h2>
            <p>
                Free software (open source) such as Agorakit is in fact free to download and install.
            </p>
            <p>
                On the other hand, development, maintenance and technical support cost money (or rather a lot of time, mostly unpaid :-)).
            </p>
            <p>
                By making a donation, you support the project and allow the developer to free up time to improve the software and benefit everyone.
            </p>

            <h2 class="mt-5">Is payment secure?</h2>

            <p>
                We use <a href="https://donorbox.org/" target="_blank">Donorbox</a>, one of the most used donation providers. Your banking data never passes through our servers.
            </p>

            <h2 class="mt-5">Where is Agorakit hosted?</h2>

            <p>
                In France, at <a href="https://alwaysdata.com" target="_blank">Alwaysdata</a>, an excellent hosting provider <a href="https://www.alwaysdata.com//fr/ transparency/">which has</a> <a href="https://www.alwaysdata.com//fr/green-it/">some</a> <a href="https://www. alwaysdata.com//en/open-source/">values</a>.
                <br />
                Your data is safe thanks to a powerful host that offers daily backup for 30 days.
            </p>




            <h2 class="mt-5">Who holds my data?</h2>

            <p>
                You are and always will be the owner of your data. It is always possible for a group to export data and reinstall it elsewhere.
                <br />
                Agorakit is open source software: this means that you can host "your" Agorakit elsewhere at any time. You are not stuck on a proprietary platform.
